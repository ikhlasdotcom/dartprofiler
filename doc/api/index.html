  <h1 id="dartprofiler">dartprofiler</h1>
<p>Based on Casey Muratori's C++ profiler and repetition tester in his Computer
Enhance course, this tool lets you profile and time specific segments of your
Dart code with minimal overhead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Uses Dart FFI so that you can speak with CPU directly (overhead is less than
Stopwatch, but can't be inlined on an assembly level, analysis done below)</li>
<li>Independent from Dart's and Flutters profiling tools, which allows you to run
it even in flutter's <code>release</code> mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>This tool is by no means perfect. I pulled it together really quickly to get
some performance data for a project I was on short-term which I found the Dart
DevTools to be unsatisfactory. I apologise in advance to anyone finds the setup
process a pain. It has been open-sourced to give you an example as to how you
can approach your own profiler, or hopefully, this profiler is improved upon by
community-driven effort.</p>
<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
<ul>
<li>The lightweightness gives you a picture of your how performant the segment of your
code is, with minimal distortions.</li>
<li>You ought to be able to talk to the CPU directly. All the drudge work of
setting up the FFI into C++ has been done.</li>
<li>The repetition tester allows you to time how long your code will take in the
best case scenario, on top of counting page faults. The statefulness of the
CPU becomes less of a concern.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>A lot of work is needed on the part of the developer to actually get all this
working. If all this work doesn't seem worth it, you can replace the ticks in
<code>dartprofiler.dart</code> with stopwatch ticks. It's a little less efficient, but it
gets the job done.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have only tried this with an Android device for a Flutter
app. The setup provides a lot of instructions for that particular context. At
the very least, I have linked some resources to make your life a little
easier. Everyone has to go through step 1 and 2. Steps 3 and 4 will differ
depending on how you are building the c++ code, whether you are using Flutter,
and which platform you are on.</p>
<p><a href="https://dart.dev/interop/c-interop">This</a> is the official documentation for c
interop in Dart. <a href="https://dart.dev/interop/c-interop#bundle-and-load-c-libraries">The Bundle and load C
libraries</a>
section should be extra important to you if you are on a platform that differs
from the steps below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone/download the repository, and import dartprofiler as dependency in your
flutter app. For more information about <code>path:</code>, read <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/using-packages#dependencies-on-unpublished-packages">the official documentation</a>.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"># In pubspec.yaml

# ...

dev_dependencies:
  # ...
  dartprofiler:
    path: "../path/to/dartprofiler"
  # ...

# ...

</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Copy the <code>dartprofiler_lib</code> into the root of your app, you can rename it if
you would like. If you are using flutter, you can ignore <code>build.sh</code> and rely
solely on CMakeLists.txt. <code>build.sh</code> gives you an example of how you can compile
the <code>cpp</code> code. If you would like to modify <code>cpp</code> side of things, you would
have to look at <code>libdartprofiler.cpp</code>. I have provided examples for <code>rdtsc</code>
and <code>cntvct_el0</code>.</li>
<li>If you're relying on the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> to build your c++ library (like for
Flutter developers), make sure your build knows about the c++ library. For Android, add
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/tools/gradle-api/8.0/com/android/build/api/dsl/ExternalNativeBuild"><code>externalNativeBuild</code></a> in <code>android/app/build.gradle</code>, as below. Make sure that
it's pointing to the aforementioned <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>. I haven't tried
it with any other platform. If you figure it out, feel free to make a PR to
add to this <code>README</code>.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="language-dart"><code>externalNativeBuild {
    // ...
    cmake {
        path "../../dartprofiler_library/CMakeLists.txt"
    }
    // ...
}

</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>If you are talking to the CPU, make sure your build knows about it. For
Flutter development on Android, add the following to
<code>android/app/build.gradle</code>. If you are running in a mode other than release,
replace <code>release</code> with that mode, like <code>debug</code>. Replace <code>"arm64-v8a"</code> with
your particular ABI.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="language-dart"><code>// ...
buildTypes {
    release {
        // TODO: Add your own signing config for the release build.
        // Signing with the debug keys for now, so `flutter run --release` works.
        signingConfig = signingConfigs.debug

        ndk {
            abiFilters "arm64-v8a"
        }
    }
}
// ...

<h3 id="dartprofiler-2"><code>dartprofiler</code></h3>
<p>The following is a gist of how one would use this library to profile a segment
of their code.</p>
<pre class="language-dart"><code class="language-dart">// Tip: Import as a unique name, like `dp`, so you can just for `dp` to find
where you are using the profiler.

import 'package:dartprofiler/dartprofiler.dart' as dp;

void main() {
    doSomeStuff1();
    
    // Suppose we are interested in `doSomeStuff2` and `doSomeStuff3` only, we can surround it with
    `beginProfile` and `endAndPrintProfile` so that the profiler ignores
    `doSomeStuff1`. 
    
    
    dp.beginProfile();
    
    // Suppose we want to know the individual time spent by doSomeStuff2 and
    doSomeStuff3. We can use `markStart` and `markEnd`, or their alias, `s` and
    `e` respectively.
    
    final b0 = dp.s("doSomeStuff2", 0);
    doSomeStuff2(5);
    dp.e(b0);
    
    final b1 = dp.s("doSomeStuff3", 1);
    doSomeStuff3();
    dp.e(b1);
    
    dp.endAndPrintProfile();
}
</code></pre>
<p>For a reference on the API, see the
<a href="/doc/api/dartprofiler/dartprofiler-library.html">documentation</a>. You only need
to care about everything in <code>Functions</code>, and <code>e</code> and <code>s</code>. Note that <code>e</code> and <code>s</code>
are aliases for <code>markStart</code> and <code>markEnd</code> respectively.</p>
<h3 id="stubdartprofiler"><code>stubdartprofiler</code></h3>
<p>Exactly the same API as <code>dartprofiler</code>, but all the procedures, except
<code>beginProfile</code> and <code>endAndPrintProfile</code>, do nothing. The two procedures that do
something calculate the total time spent in the profiled code segment. The
purpose of this is to allow you to get a baseline on how long your code is
taking with basically no intrusion from the profiler. You can then compare this
number with how long your profiled code segment takes with <code>dartprofiler</code>. The
difference indicates how intrusive your profiling is.</p>

<p>I am not actively improving the library as I am no longer using Dart, but I
will keep my eyes open for pull requests.</p>
<h3 id="project-sturcture">Project Sturcture</h3>
<pre class="language-dart"><code>This profiler is not a command-line application, and hence, there is no
`bin/`. I was lazy, so the `test/` is empty.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="using-classes-as-structs">Using Classes as Structs</h3>
<pre class="language-dart"><code>Methods aren't used even though the data definitions are defined with
classes. This isn't a political statement against object-oriented
programming. I happen to find it easier to reason about the program when
there is a clear separation between data and code that acts on them. Perhaps
there is a way to blur that line in a productive way while maintaining the
minimal overhead, but I haven't bothered with it.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="disadvantages--room-for-improvements">Disadvantages &amp; Room for Improvements</h3>
<pre class="language-dart"><code>- You need manually track the `uid`. The printing at the the results
associated with `uid` in ascending order.
- As of now, there can only be 16 uids (0 - 15). You can have more by
changing the constant in `lib/dartprofiler.dart`. The idea is that all the
memory is allocated before the profiling begins. 
- Calling into C++ is not as cheap and uninstrusive as calling
  inlined-assembly in C++. As far as I am aware, currently, there is no way of getting
  around this.
- You need to specify both the start and end, it would be nice to just say
  that you would like to treat an entire block as a zone. Dart has recently
  introduced [macros](https://dart.dev/language/macros), perhaps it's
  possible to do that now?
- Every variant of dartprofiler requires you to copy from `dartprofiler`,
  creating multiple sources of truth. For example, `stubdartprofiler`
  clearly has a lot of overlap with `dartprofiler`. It would be nice if
  there was a way to add compiler flags to add/remove certain parts of the
  profiler, or a way to parameterize over with 0 runtime costs.
- Getting the baseline performance with `stubdartprofiler` requires you to
  actually modify the code, which is tedious and error-prone. Moreover,
  requiring to maintain `stubdartprofiler` which is just a copy of
  `dartprofiler` with many things removed is tedious. Furthermore,
  some of the lines of code for the dart profiler are actually still
  executed. Ideally, there should be a way to use a macro compile a version
  of the code without the implementation, instead of having to resort to an
  alternate library with empty implementations.
- The documentation is automatically generated by `dart doc .`, and it may
  include documentation on things that the library user don't need to know
  about. For instance, it exposes the fields of `ProfileBlock` when the
  library user does not, and should not, know about them.
